I wish I knew how to explain in simple terms why I like the programming language Clojure so much. It's such a strange, beautiful thing; yet honestly I find myself struggling to think of anything meaningful to say about it. Like most things in life, it's just hard to appreciate without experiencing first hand.

I love learning new programming languages.
For me, the journey has been a bit as follows:

&ltCS 101&gt

"Ewe, I'm not sure I can be a programmer. Java seems really intimidating."
...
"Oh my God! Python is amazing! I can do anything! This feels really powerful. I can imagine it, type it, and see real things come to fruition. Yep I think programming is for me."
...
"Okay, so I guess Java isn't that bad. I can transfer things I've learned from Python back to Java. There's just more typing involved."
...
...

&ltYear 2 of being a Java fullstack developer&gt

"I really like this jQuery map function. I wonder why I can't do anything like this server side?"
...
"Oh, okay, there's some JVM languages with things like map. It's just Java that makes this sort of thing difficult."
...
"Oh wow. Scala is amazing. I've never typed so little and done so much in my life. Let's see what this other JVM functional language is all about."
...
"Lisp syntax? Macros? What is all of this? How are all of these libraries that I'm looking at so small? Certainly I still have so much to learn."

And what a learning experience it's been.
Each new language I've endeavored to learn has been like a new turn in my journey to become a better programmer. 
With each new language I've learned new ways to solve old problems. Each language has had its own impression on me. 
For example, after learning Scala and its object keyword I felt like I could see the singleton pattern in a new light.
Clojure has been the same way - but to an even greater extent.
Now I can look at a piece of Java code, imagine how I would do the same thing in Clojure, and immediately see ways in which the Java code can be less convoluted, or "complected". 

In a way, becoming such a Clojure enthusiast does feel almost like a religious experience. 
There are many philosophies and beliefs that I've come to follow, delivered by great evangelists such as Rich Hickey (the creator of Clojure).

I've come to value a programming language in many ways by the merits of its collections library. 
In my opinion, this is really what sets Clojure (and Scala) apart from languages such as Python and Java that I've learned in the past. 
Confidence is tricky when you're a programmer. It's easy to be full of self doubt and to think that you can never accomplish x or y. But with Clojure, there's this feeling that if I can just outline my problem in the world of Clojure's collections library, well then I'm at least half way there. Things that once seemed daunting - such as robustness and scalability, all of a sudden feel like they're being handed out for free. 

There's also something else about Clojure, that is really different from even another functional programming language like Scala. 
I really can't adequately put it into words. Maybe see https://xkcd.com/297/. 
It definitely has to do with Clojure being a lisp.
"Timeless" is certainly a good word.
"Elegant" (in a minimalist way) is another.
For example, I think everyone would be rather shocked if after first coming in contact with aliens, we found out that they have their own programming language that looks an awful lot like Java. However I'm not sure the same is true with Clojure. Of course I don't mean that we'd find English tokens or greek alphabet characters. But it may would be "homoiconic", ie mirroring in a very close way the resulting abstract syntax tree that gets constructed. 

Okay. I'm at aliens now.
I think I've probably written enough here in failing to sufficiently explain why I'm so grateful to have stumbled upon such a beautiful tool like Clojure. 
It's foreign yet completely natural, illuminating and powerful yet minimalistic, and really just one hell of an experience that you have to try first hand in order to understand.
